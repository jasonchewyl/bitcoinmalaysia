# Welcome to BitcoinMalaysia

## What is BitcoinMalaysia

BitcoinMalaysia is a community group that was founded by Colbert Low since 2012. 

Started really small as a simple blog website and over many meetups, _'teh tarik'_ and _'yum cha'_ sessions has organically grown to become the largest cryptocommunity our country has to date. 

As of 20 March 2020, we have 56,000 people in our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/BitcoinMalaysia) community group.  
22,000 people are actively monthly. And we still have a lot more to grow.

> Note: Although we are strong advocates of Bitcoin, we are open advocates to ALL cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects. As long as you are not scamming people and are solving real problems, we welcome you into our community and would love to help you leverage on our platform to find success.

## Our Mission

Cryptocurrencies are difficult to learn, unfamiliar to new people and the industry is filled with bad actors. However, there are many exciting projects and developments in the space but they just don't have the time nor patience to wait for laggards to play catch up. Most developing nations, unfortunately, are laggards. They do not like uncertainty. They rather wait and see than to be an early adopter.  
  
That is why the role BitcoinMalaysia wishes to play is to change that by

* Providing a safe, neutral and friendly place for new people to learn about cryptocurrencies.
* Educating new people how to identify **the real and the fake projects** quickly within the space.
* Creating a more mature community so that we can attract good projects into the country. 
* Developing easier ways, methodologies and tools for people to experience cryptocurrencies.
* Inspiring people to BUIDL and solve problems using decentralised ledger technologies.
* Helping blockchain companies find user adoption, fans and champions.  

> In addition to the above, we aspire to **help prepare more Malaysians to contribute and find jobs in the crypto industry** as a lot of people are going to need new sources of income due to nationwide lockdowns caused by the global pandemic of COVID-19.
